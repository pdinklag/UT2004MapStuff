UT2004 Map Stuff
================
This is a collection of modded items, weapons, vehicles, you name it, that I extracted from certain maps into standalone mods. Doing this makes it possible to easily import them into other maps, or use them for other purposes such as randomized vehicle spawners, etc.

I claim no copyright on any of these mods. Many of these have been around for ages and it's kinda impossible to track down the original authors. If you are an original author of one of these mods, please let me know if you wish that I remove it.

Building
--------
Each subdirectory is a standalone mod that can be compiled like any other UT2004 package.
